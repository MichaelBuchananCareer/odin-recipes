    <h2>World's best lasagna</h2>
    <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F.<br>
       Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes.<br>
       Also, it's important to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.
    </p>
