    <h2>Incredible Cheese Puff Sliders</h2>
    <p style="width: 300;">
        For these cheese puff sliders, Chef John shows you first how to make incredible French cheese puff 'buns,' which you then use to make the most delicious, most interesting fun-size cheeseburgers you've ever had. They're dressed with secret sauce (a secret no more), lettuce, tomato, and pickle. The cheese is already in the bun.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4>Cheese Puff Buns</h4>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into slices</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <h4>Secret Sauce</h4>
        <li>6 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons mustard</li>
        <h4>Sliders</h4>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 cherry tomatoes, cut into 4 slices each</li>
        <li>12 bread and butter pickle slices</li>
        <li>heart of Romaine lettuce leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat. Toss Gruyere cheese and Cheddar cheese together in a small bowl to combine; set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir water, butter, and salt together in a pot; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium and stir flour into butter mixture with a wooden spoon until a paste-like dough forms, 2 to 3 minutes. At this point, you will notice a film forming on the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook for at least 1 minute more, scraping up the film as best you can. Turn off heat; continue to stir dough briskly and scrape the bottom of the pan for about 1 minute more; moisture from dough should “deglaze” the pan and incorporate most of the film into the dough. Transfer dough to a bowl to cool until warm, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir 1 egg, cayenne, and black pepper into cooled dough until egg is completely incorporated—the mixture will separate, but keep stirring vigorously. Add remaining egg and stir until completely incorporated into dough. Fold in half of cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Scoop 12 equal balls of dough onto prepared baking sheet using a small scoop. Top each with an equal amount of remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Place in the center of the preheated oven (450 degrees F/235 degrees C); immediately reduce temperature to 375 F (190 degrees C), and bake until puffed and golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool on the pan for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove buns to a wire rack to cool completely, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>For secret sauce, stir mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>For sliders, portion beef into 12 (2 ounce) balls, and then press into 1/4-inch thick patties. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Cook in a skillet over medium-high heat, undisturbed, until a good crust forms on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn patties over, cook, undisturbed, until meat springs back from the touch and juice begins to leak out the top, 2 to 3 minutes for medium rare. Let rest 2 to 3 minutes before assembling sliders. </li>
        <li>Slice puffs open like a bun, and dress each with 1 tablespoon secret sauce. Top with burger, pickle, tomato, and lettuce, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
